**Stability of function classes defined by deep neural network classifiers.**
This repository contains the code developed for the end-of-degree project in Computer Science and Mathematics in the University of Granada.

**Adversarial attacks implemented:**
 - Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)
 - DeepFool
 - SparseFool
 - One Pixel Attack
 - Universal Adversarial Perturbation


See notebook `cifar10_experiments.ipynb` to perform attacks in the CIFAR10 dataset and notebook `ImageNet_experiments.ipynb` to use the above methods in any image from the internet, using models pretrained on ImageNet.
